# CS-300
In project one we were tasked with creating a psuedocode document containing 3 different methods of organizing
data from a file. In project Two we were tasked with using said psuedocode and turning it into a fully 
functional program. Data structures are important to understand because there are many different types of data 
and files and if you can understand the different ways to organize and sort the data. You will be able to build
a more efficent program. Anytime i faced a challenge in this class i used a tutor from the school to get a 
better understanding of what was being asked. The work on these projects helped me get a better understanding 
of the way you can read files and organize them. It also helped me learn how to get better while writing my
psuedocode and then writing the code based off the psuedocode. I also had to focus more on my comments to make
sure the code is understandable if i ever wanted to use or change it in any way in the future.
